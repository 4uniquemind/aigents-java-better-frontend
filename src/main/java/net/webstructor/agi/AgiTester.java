DONE:
1. Learning without compression
2. Make random
3. Add approximating
TODO:
4. Unit test!
5. Add forgetting
6. Learning with compression
7. Both increase happiness and decrease pain
8. Add energy consumption
9. Add restarts on failures
10. Do computation of derivative?

Results (20 runs, 1100/3600/7500 epochs):
Game/Player		2X4	4X6	6X8	8X10	2X4d4X6d6X8d8X10d
Function/bas	89	88	88	92		70	73	72	85
Discrete/bas   	89	88	88	...		
Function/neg	92	90	90	93		67	73	81	85
Discrete/neg   	92	90	90	...
Function/fuz0.5	93	93	93	93		80	83	81	89
Discrete/fuz0.5 93	91	88	...

Conclustions:
1) Both Functional and Discrete representations of the environment are handleable nearly to the same extent
2) Functional representation is slightly better from the accuracy perspective amd much better from the run-time performance perspective
3) Both a) negating bad experiences and b) fuzzy matching help improving learning speed
4) Delayed reward complicates learning to extent of ~10%
