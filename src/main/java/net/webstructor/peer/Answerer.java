				- Iterate over weighted surprising wors
					- Iterate over texts with every word 
					- "count" every text matching every word using surprisingness as a double (!!!) count value 
					- if no texts found, keep iterating with less surprising word
					- if one text is found - return it
					- if more than one text is found, select the most counted
